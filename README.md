This repository contains an implementation for a Database System.

It includes:
1. Efficient Join Algorithms
2. Query Plan Optimizer
3. Queuing for concurrent requests on resources,
4. Multigranular Locks
5. ARIES Recovery System


Database.java - Database objects keeps track of transactions, tables, and indices and delegates work to its disk manager, buffer manager, lock manager and recovery manager.

query/join/ - Implementation for join algorithms such as block nested loop join, sort merge, and grace hash join.

query/QueryPlan.java - Optimizer to search tree for best query plan 

concurrency/ - Implements concurrent requests on a database for resources all the way from the table level to the indiviudal record level.

recovery/ - Implements ARIESREcoveryManager with write-ahead logging, support for savepoints and rollbacks, and ACID compliant restart recovery.

table/ - Contains Table and PageDirectory objects used to manage the operations in a database.
